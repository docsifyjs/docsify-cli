# Contributing to the development of `docsify-cli`

- Fork the repository on Github.
- Clone the repository locally.
- Make your changes to the code.
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build`.
- Run `npm link` which creates a symlink and thereby `docsify` can be accessed globally.
- After each edit, rerun `npm run build` so the new executable would be globally available.
- We use [commitlint conventional naming rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/config-conventional#rules) for our commits, make sure that you follow them.
- Push to Github and open a pull request.
